## Welcome to MY Data science project learning journal

# Self-intro

On 2020 Nov 28, I decided to try my best to land in data science area. There were 2 triggers: one was I felt I was going to be fired, which was pros significently outweighted cons. The 2nd was a private DS training based on a algo trading project from Dec 2 to end of March 2021 and I would have time to follow this training. (syllabus: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12eQu5zkDkui7iwZMovxsOZQOLSZ1hQy-TmyQZBnkGpQ/edit#slide=id.p10. I brought www.datacamp.com with the black friday discoun and used it for me to lay the DS fundation in Python, statistic etc. (My sql was already ok)

Today I found this: a project for Financial Investment Risk Management. https://medium.com/learn-from-machines/part-0-project-description-7f74ff7aae78 The mission is divided into DATA ENGINEERING/DATA SCIENCE/MACHINE LEARNING/INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT. It is much difficult to become a data scientist from 0 to 1. Honestly, The most regetable thing in my life would be if I could not have a great career path (even worse than die alone). I believe do some projects is needed to get myself employable/job-ready in DS, and this one looks good. **Bold** Feel free to inform me anything you feel could help me to be a better man which means dont have to be DS or IT professional related things.
